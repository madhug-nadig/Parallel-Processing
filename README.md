# Parallel-Processing-Nadig
Repository for parallel processing.

This repository contains both parallelized algorithms and tutorials/examples of parallel computing mechanisms in different languages.

## Parallelized algorithms:
  1. K-Nearest Neighbours - Machine Learning
  2. Similarity Metrics - Algorithms for finding the similarity between data points
    * Euclidean Distance
    * Cosine Similarity
    * Manhattan Distance
    * Minskowski Distance
    * Jaccard Similarity
    
## Implementations | Examples | Tutorials:

#### Parallel Computing in Python using Multiprocessing library
   * Using Multiprocessing Pools
   * Using Multiprocessing Processes
    
#### Parallel Computing in C using OpenMP
   * Linear Search
   * Selection Sort
   * Merge Sort
#### Parallel Computing in JavScript using Web Workers
   * THree Hump Camel Function
   * Task Parallelism: Quicksort and Mergesort
   * Pixel Manipulation
